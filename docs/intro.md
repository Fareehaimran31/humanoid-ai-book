# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Brains to Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This course bridges AI theory and real-world robotics by teaching you how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern AI systems.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four main modules plus a capstone project:

- **Module 1**: ROS 2 – Robotic Nervous System
- **Module 2**: Digital Twins – Gazebo & Unity
- **Module 3**: AI Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac Lab
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action Systems
- **Capstone**: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

Each module builds upon the previous one, taking you from fundamental ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI integration and finally to an autonomous humanoid robot that combines all learned concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Intermediate Python skills with basic machine learning knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic understanding of AI and robotics concepts

## Learning Approach

This course follows a simulation-first approach with hands-on experiences. You'll learn by doing, implementing real-world robotics scenarios in simulation environments before considering physical hardware applications.

## Technical Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- Python 3.8 or higher
- GPU with at least 4GB VRAM (for simulation)
- 8GB+ RAM, 50GB+ free disk space
- Development tools: Git, Docker (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

Start with Module 1 to establish the foundational knowledge needed for all other modules. Each module includes:
- Concept overview with architecture diagrams
- Code snippets and examples
- Hands-on lab instructions
- Assessment criteria

Navigate to the next page to begin with ROS 2 fundamentals, where you'll learn about the robotic nervous system that connects all components of your robot.
