# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Brains to Embodied Intelligence

This educational resource bridges AI theory and real-world robotics by teaching students how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern AI systems. The course covers ROS 2, digital twins (Gazebo/Unity), NVIDIA Isaac Lab, and vision-language-action systems, culminating in an autonomous humanoid robot capstone project.

## Course Structure

- **Module 1**: ROS 2 – Robotic Nervous System
- **Module 2**: Digital Twins – Gazebo & Unity
- **Module 3**: AI Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac Lab
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action Systems
- **Capstone**: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

For GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Course Objectives

Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2 communication patterns
- Simulate humanoid robots in Gazebo and Unity environments
- Develop AI control systems using NVIDIA Isaac Lab
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems for autonomous behavior
- Complete an autonomous humanoid robot capstone project
